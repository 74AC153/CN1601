finish uart
add show coproc N
add to spec: trap behavior table
//memory faults don't cause interrupts in superuser mode -> software must check
//add memory fault pending bits to IPEND register
add ability to get/set reg/state values in sim
add reset pin
//more regular output (1 line per item) in sim
//replace literals with enum values in big sim_exec case statement
remove exint_ack bus from spec (replace with coproc op
make ordering of input/output/etc inside subroutines to cycle() consistent
modify cpop to set bits on cp address bus too instead of wasting
honor outbuflen in generate_opcodes
add linking for assembler
add binary offsets for assembler 

update spec

add hardware breakpoint?


full command list taken from spim:
quit
load file offset
run offset
step num
continue
print {sN|uN|cN|mem addr|...}
break addr
delete addr
list
read addr
disassemble addr
write addr val
assemble addr ...
show

changes {on|off}
tracing {on|off}

if we are in a memory delay slot and the address changes, we need to reset the delay counter?
--> no, just use the original address
